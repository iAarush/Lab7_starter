Question 1: Answer: 1
Question 2: Answer: No
Question 3: Answer: Snapshot mode takes a "snapshot" i.e. holds the page in its current state before running an audit on that static page. Navigation mode focuses on a full page load process and gives a score to that, but ignores dynamic changes that may happen after the page loads. 
Question 4: We could serve static images with a more efficient caching policy, per the PageSpeed Insights report. There's also a silver chain bracelet that may be a larger load element than others, so some specific optimizations for that product could be considered.
